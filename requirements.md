<p>Cleaned up transcript:</p>
<p>"I'm trying to build an escrow service. It should allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once signed up, they will be presented with a dashboard where they can perform various actions. One action is the ability to create a project. The project creation process will begin with a questionnaire that guides the user through a series of questions. After completing the questionnaire, a list of potential features will be provided, similar to the code engine. From there, they can generate the requirements for the project.</p>
<p>The requirements breakdown will involve taking prompts and using a GPT model or LLM model to plan the potential features. Each feature will be saved to the requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they can review the requirements in its entirety. The requirements will be sent to the developer or service provider portal to notify them of a new project and provide a list of projects. </p>
<p>The requirements can then be broken down into stories, which can be grouped into sets of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, and these features can be further broken down into stories. This process can be used to write Gherkin and kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and list of stories. A proposal will be generated from the initial requirements data, including pricing from the quote engine. This proposal will be sent to the client for feedback. Once approved, it becomes a contract with milestones, requirements, and costs for each milestone. </p>
<h2>The client will be able to view the project and milestones in a project view. Once a developer or service provider starts working on the features, they can be organized into stories on the Azure DevOps board. Once a milestone is completed, a webhook will be sent to update the milestone status. The developer can upload an asset or submit a pull request for the feature. The asset will be stored in the digital assets section, which can include files, images, HTML</h2>
