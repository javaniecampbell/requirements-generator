<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<h2>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be presented with their dashboard where they'll have a series of actions. They'll be able to create a project, which will start with a questionnaire. The questionnaire will guide the person through a series of questions to initially create a project. Once the questionnaire is completed, it will provide them with a list of potential features similar to the code engine. They can then generate the requirements from the selected features. The requirements breakdown will take a set of prompts that will ask an AI model to plan the potential features. Each requirement will be saved to our requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they will be able to review the requirements in its entirety. Once the requirements are generated, they will be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to indicate the creation of a new project. The requirements can then be broken down into stories, grouped into a set number of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, which can then be further broken down into stories. The AI model will plan the features and the breakdown of stories. These broken-down features can be used to write gherkin to kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and the list of stories. A proposal will be generated from the initial requirements data, including pricing from the quote engine. The proposal will be sent to the client with feedback. Once the client approves, it will turn into a contract with milestones and costs for each milestone. The client will be added to a project view with all the milestones that need to be accomplished. A developer or service provider can then start working on the features, which can be managed as stories on Azure DevOps board</h2>
