<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<p>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be presented with their dashboard where they'll have a series of actions. They'll be able to create a project, which will start with a questionnaire. The questionnaire will guide them through a series of questions to initially create a project. Once the questionnaire is completed, it will provide them with a list of potential features. Once that is presented, they can generate the requirements from the code. The requirements breakdown will take a set of prompts that will ask a GPT model or LLM model to plan the potential features, and each one will be saved to our requirements table.</p>
<p>Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they will be able to review the requirements in its entirety. The requirements will then be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to indicate that a new project has been created. Once that is done, the requirements can be broken down into stories, grouped into a set number of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, and those features can then be broken down into stories. The LLM will plan what the features are, and the same process will be done for breaking down stories into smaller bits.</p>
<h2>These broken-down features can be used to write Gherkin later, which will kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and the list of stories. From the initial requirements data, we will generate a proposal that includes the pricing from the quote engine. The proposal will be sent to the client and will include feedback based on any necessary changes. Once the client approves, it will turn into a contract that will be sent to the client. The contract will include milestones, requirements, and the associated cost for each</h2>
