<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<h2>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow for developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be presented with their dashboard where they'll have a series of actions. One of these actions is to create a project. The project will start with a questionnaire that will guide the person through a series of questions to initially create the project. Once the questionnaire is completed, it will give them a list of potential features similar to the code engine. From there, they can go ahead and generate the requirements. The requirements breakdown will take a set of prompts that will ask a GPT or LLM model to plan the potential features. Each requirement will be saved to our requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they can review the requirements in its entirety. The requirements will then be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to notify them of a new project and provide a list of projects. The requirements can then be broken down into stories, grouped into a set number of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, which can also be broken down into stories. This can be used to write Gherkin and kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and list of stories. From the initial requirements data, we will generate a proposal that includes the pricing from the quote engine. The proposal will be sent to the client for feedback. Once the client approves, it will turn into a contract and be sent to the client with the milestones, requirements, and costs for each milestone. The client can create a project, submit what they want based on a questionnaire, and also submit free text, which will be parsed into requirements and reviewed for the contract. Once the client reviews and signs the contract, they will be</h2>

Can you complete unfinished user stories given the context here, let's think about it step by step before giving a detail response for the other user stories

Certainly! Let's first think through the context and steps involved to ensure we're on the right track for completing the unfinished user stories.

### Steps for Completing Unfinished User Stories:

1. **Understand the Existing Context**: Review the details of the project, functional and non-functional requirements, and the partially written user stories.
2. **Identify the Missing Information**: Pinpoint where the user stories are incomplete and what specific details are required.
3. **Define Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure each user story is clear, concise, and includes specific acceptance criteria to verify its completion.
4. **Review the Functional Flow**: Ensure the functional requirements and user stories align with the overall system flow and goals.

### Completed Context and Steps:

#### Epic: User Management

1. **User Registration**: Already complete.

2. **Dashboard**: Already complete.

#### Epic: Project Management

3. **Project Creation**: Already complete.

4. **Requirement Generation**: Already complete.

5. **Requirement Review**: Already complete.

6. **Requirement Breakdown**: Already complete.

7. **Gherkin Writing**: Already complete.

#### Epic: Proposal and Contract Management

8. **Proposal Generation**: Already complete.

9. **Contract Creation**: Already complete.

#### Non-functional Requirements

10. **Usability**: Already complete.

11. **Performance**: Already complete.

12. **Reliability**: Already complete.

### Unfinished User Stories:

We have identified two user stories that are incomplete or missing from the provided content. Let’s focus on these:

13. **Integration with Developer or Service Provider Portal**:

    **User Story**:  
     **As a** user,  
     **I want** the platform to be integrated with the developer or service provider portal,  
     **So that** developers and service providers are notified and provided with a list of projects.

    **Acceptance Criteria**:

    **Given** the platform is integrated with the developer or service provider portal,  
    **When** a new project is created,  
    **Then** developers or service providers should be notified of the new project,  
    **And** they should be able to access a list of projects through the portal.

14. **Parsing Free Text Submissions**:

    **User Story**:
    **As a** user,  
    **I want** the platform to parse free text submissions into requirements,  
    **So that** they can be reviewed and included in the contract.

    **Acceptance Criteria**:

    **Given** a free-text submission from a client,  
    **When** the system parses the submission,  
    **Then** it should generate requirements for inclusion in the contract,  
    **And** these requirements should be reviewed by the client and the service provider.

15. **Security**:

    **User Story**:  
    **As a** user,  
    **I want** the platform to ensure the security and confidentiality of user information and project data,  
    **So that** sensitive information is protected.

    **Acceptance Criteria**:  
    **Given** the platform is accessed by authorized personnel,  
    **When** accessing the requirements table and contract information,  
    **Then** it should ensure security and confidentiality of user information and project data,  
    **And** unauthorized access should be prevented.

### Reviewing and Refining User Stories:

Let’s refine the above stories for completeness and clarity:

### Integration with Developer or Service Provider Portal

**User Story**:  
**As a** user,  
**I want** the platform to be integrated with the developer or service provider portal,  
**So that** developers and service providers are notified and provided with a list of projects.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
**Given** the platform is integrated with the developer or service provider portal,  
**When** a new project is created,  
**Then** developers or service providers should be notified of the new project,  
**And** they should be able to access a list of projects through the portal.

### Parsing Free Text Submissions

**User Story**:
**As a** user,  
**I want** the platform to parse free text submissions into requirements,  
**So that** they can be reviewed and included in the contract.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
**Given** a free-text submission from a client,  
**When** the system parses the submission,  
**Then** it should generate requirements for inclusion in the contract,  
**And** these requirements should be reviewed by the client and the service provider.

### Security

**User Story**:  
**As a** user,  
**I want** the platform to ensure the security and confidentiality of user information and project data,  
**So** that sensitive information is protected.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
**Given** the platform is accessed by authorized personnel,  
 **When** accessing the requirements table and contract information,  
 **Then** it should ensure security and confidentiality of user information and project data,  
 **And** unauthorized access should be prevented.

With this approach, we have completed the unfinished user stories with detailed acceptance criteria. If there are any other aspects or specific details you’d like to explore further, please let me know!
