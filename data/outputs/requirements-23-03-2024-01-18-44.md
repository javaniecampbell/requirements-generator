<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<h2>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be presented with a dashboard where they'll have a series of actions. One of those actions is the ability to create a project. The project creation process starts with a questionnaire that guides the person through a series of questions to initially create the project. Once the questionnaire is completed, it will provide a list of potential features similar to the code engine. From there, the user can generate the requirements. The requirements breakdown will take a set of prompts that will ask the GPT model or LLM model to plan potential features. Each requirement will be saved to our requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they will be able to review the requirements in its entirety. The requirements will then be sent to the developer portal or the service provider portal to notify that a new project has been created. The requirements can then be broken down into stories, grouped into a set number of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features. These features can further be broken down into stories. The LLM will plan what the features are and the same thing will be done for breaking down stories into smaller bits. These broken down features can be used to write gherkin later, which will kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and the list of stories. We will generate a proposal from the initial requirements data. The proposal will include the pricing from the quote engine and the generated requirements to create a proposal. This proposal will be sent to the client and will include a series of feedback based on what needs to be changed. Once approved by the client, it will turn into a contract and will be sent to the client with milestones, requirements</h2>
