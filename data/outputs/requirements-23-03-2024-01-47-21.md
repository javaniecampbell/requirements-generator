<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<p>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. The desired functionality of this service is to allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform and access their dashboard. From the dashboard, they will be able to create projects. The project creation process will start with a questionnaire that guides them through a series of questions to initially set up the project. Once the questionnaire is completed, they will receive a list of potential features similar to the code engine. From there, they can generate the project requirements.</p>
<p>The requirements breakdown will involve taking a set of prompts to generate potential features using a GPT model or LLM model. Each feature will be saved to the requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they can review the requirements in its entirety. The generated requirements will be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to notify them of a new project and provide a list of projects.</p>
<p>Next, the requirements can be broken down into stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, and these features can further be broken down into stories. The planning of features and stories will be done using LLM. The broken down features can also be used to write gherkin to kick-start the project phase based on the requirements and the list of stories.</p>
<p>From the initial requirements data, a proposal will be generated. The proposal will include pricing information from the quote engine and the generated requirements to create a proposal. This proposal will then be sent to the client for feedback. Once the feedback is incorporated, the application will ask for the client's signature and approval. Once approved, this will turn into a contract, which will be sent to the client. The contract will include the milestones, requirements, and costs for each milestone based on the generated features and selections.</p>
<h2>Once the contract is signed by the client and reviewed,</h2>
