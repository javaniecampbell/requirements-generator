<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<p>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be presented with a dashboard where they can perform various actions. One of these actions is creating a project, which will start with a questionnaire. The questionnaire will guide them through a series of questions to initially create a project. Once the questionnaire is completed, it will provide them with a list of potential features. They can then generate the requirements from the chosen features. The requirements will be saved to our requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they can review the requirements in its entirety. The requirements will be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to notify them of a new project. The requirements can then be broken down into stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features. The features can then be further broken down into stories. The features and stories can be used to write gherkin and kick-start the project phase. </p>
<h2>From the initial requirements data, we will generate a proposal that includes pricing from the quote engine. The proposal will be sent to the client for feedback. Once approved, it will turn into a contract that includes milestones, requirements, and costs for each milestone. The client can create a project and submit their requirements via a questionnaire or free text. The requirements will be reviewed and turned into the same flow for the contract. Once all is done and the client signs the contract, they will be added to a project view with all the milestones that need to be accomplished. Once a service provider or developer starts working on the features, they can be grouped into stories on the Azure DevOps board. Once a milestone is completed, a webhook will be sent to update the status. The completed milestone can</h2>
