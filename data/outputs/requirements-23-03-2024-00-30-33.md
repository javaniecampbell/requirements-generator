<h2>Cleaned up transcript:</h2>
<h2>Alright, I'm trying to build an escrow service. What I would want it to do is allow developers or clients to sign up on the platform. Once they sign up, they will be presented with a dashboard where they'll have a series of actions. They will be able to create a project, which will start with a questionnaire. The questionnaire will guide the person through a series of questions to initially create a project. After completing the questionnaire, they will be provided with a list of potential features similar to the code engine. From there, they can generate the requirements. The requirements breakdown will take a set of prompts that will ask the GPT model or LLM model to plan the potential features. Each feature will be saved to our requirements table. Once the requirements are generated and the customer is satisfied, they will be able to review the requirements in its entirety. The generated requirements will be sent to the developer portal or service provider portal to indicate that a new project has been created. The requirements can then be broken down into stories, grouped into a set number of stories or features. Each requirement can have multiple features, and those features can be further broken down into stories. The LLM will plan the features, and the same will be done for breaking down stories into smaller parts. These broken down features can be used to write gherkin and kick-start the project phase based on the list of stories. From the initial requirements data, a proposal will be generated, including the pricing from the quote engine. The proposal, along with the requirements, will be sent to the client for feedback. Once the client approves, it will turn into a contract and be sent to the client, including the milestones with requirements and cost for each milestone. This allows the client to create a project and submit their requirements. They can also submit free text</h2>
